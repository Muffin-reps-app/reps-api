# Reps-Api

The idea for this application came from a friend! I asked for ideas for an application and he said: 

"If I gave you all the zip codes the sales reps in my region cover, could you build an interactive map where if I scroll my mouse over it or search by zip, it returns that repâ€™s name and displays where that zip is?" 

Express GraphQL was used to create a database that will hold reps names, unique ID's, and service zipcodes. I'm still working on creating a frontend for this applicaiton that will utilize this data and will likely post a link here once I've had a little time to build it out!
